# Nintendo Trivia Game!

## Features:
* Questions and answers are completely randomized each play thorugh due to the fisher and yates shuffling algorithm
* A QuizTimer object allots you 15 seconds to answer each question before moving on
* The entire trivia game is constructed as a single object aside from button clicks
* At the end of the game, the number of correct and incorrect answers will displayed, and you will be given an option to play again

## Things I think I want to add:
* Potentially add sounds and audio based on answering questions (in)correctly
* Add audio that changes when there is only a few seconds left to answer a question
* Add in related trivia between each question like:

"Correct! Nintendo went on to try other business ventures before settling on videogames, at one point even operating love hotels"
